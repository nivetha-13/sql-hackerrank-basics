--Problem Statement

/*
Given a table TRIANGLES that holds data for three fields namely A, B, C.
+-------------+------------+
| Column      |   Type     |
+-------------+------------+
| A           | INTEGER    |
| B           | INTEGER    |
| C           | INTEGER    |
+-------------+------------+
 
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral   : It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles     : It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene       : It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
